  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    I am a second-year Ph.D. student working in cryptography at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. I am co-advised by <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tessaro/">Stefano Tessaro</a> and <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rachel/">Rachel Lin</a>.
  </p>
  <!--<p>
    I visited CMU as a research intern in 2019 and worked with <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~goyal/">Vipul Goyal</a> on various topics in cryptography, including non-malleable secret sharing, Blockchain protocols, and secure multiparty computation protocols.
  </p>-->
  <p>
    I am interested in cryptography and also in related fields of theoretical computater science. I love solving concrete, discrete problems. My currently focus is on various signature schemes, such as blind signatures and threshold signatures.
